This repository has a Jupyter Notebook that tests how well K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Radius Neighbors (RNN) classifiers work on the Wine Dataset from sklearn. This dataset has three groups of wines based on their chemical properties.  The notebook loads and prepares the dataset by dividing it into 80% training sets and 20% testing sets. It then uses KNN with k values of 1, 5, 11, 15, and 21 to test accuracy and RNN with radius values of 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 to do the same. It then uses matplotlib plots to show accuracy trends while comparing the models' performances, pointing out that KNN has higher peak accuracies and is more sensitive to parameters than RNN.
